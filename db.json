Keep your head up and chest out as you lift - this will help you keep your back aligned properly.

First Pull Phase  Lift the bar from the floor by forcefully extending the hips and the knees as you exhale. Tip: The upper torso should maintain the same angle. Do not bend at the waist yet and do not let the hips rise before the shoulders (this would have the effect of pushing the glutes in the air and stretching the hamstrings. Keep elbows fully extended with the head in a neutral position and the shoulders over the bar. As the bar raises keep it as close to the shins as possible.  3. Transition or Scoop Phase  As the bar passes the knees, thrust your hips forward and slightly bend the knees to avoid locking them. Tip: At this point your thighs should be against the bar. Keep the back flat or slightly arched, elbows fully extended and your head neutral. Tip: You will hold your breath until the next phase.  4. Second Pull Phase  Inhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes. Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. Tip: Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position. Also, keep your shoulders over the bar and arms straight as long as possible. When your lower body joints are fully extended, shrug the shoulders upward rapidly without letting the elbows flex yet. Exhale during this portion of the movement. As the shoulders reach their highest elevation flex your elbows to begin pulling your body under the bar. Continue to pull the arms as high and as long as possible. Tip: Due to the explosive nature of this phase, your torso will be erect or with an arched back, your head will be tilted back slightly and your feet may lose contact with the floor.  5. Catch Phase  After the lower body has fully extended and the bar reaches near maximal height, pull your body under the bar and rotate the arms around and under the bar. Simultaneously, flex the hips and knees into a quarter squat position. Once the arms are under the bar, inhale and then lift your elbows to position the upper arms parallel to the floor. Rack the bar across the front of your collar bones and front shoulder muscles. Catch the bar with an erect and tight torso, a neutral head position and flat feet. Exhale during this movement. Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.  6. Downward Movement Phase  Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement. Simultaneously flex the hips and knees to cushion the impact of the bar on the thighs. Squat down with the elbows fully extended until the bar touches the floor. Start over at Phase 1 and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",

      "video": "wt0qF-k9is8",
      "Sort": "A Push Jerk is a progression of the push press in which a forceful hip drive coupled with a drop under the bar--a catch--is used to aid in getting the load overhead. The push jerk adds a jump and dip landing to the push press. It takes a lot of practice to get good at this movement and you should train with a dowel or bar every workout as a skill warmup.",

The lift is complete when the arms are locked out overhead, with the head \"through the window\", and the feet are reset into the jump stance (directly under the hips).",
      "tips": "It is important to have active shoulders, and a small dip to facilitate the drive of the load upwards. The drop under the bar makes it so the load doesn't have to travel as far to make the catch easier. Note that the dip is not so low as to be a front squat, which takes away the stretch that helps drive the force up enough to pull underneath it during the catch. It is also common to \"jump\" the legs from hip width into a squat stance, where the hips are about shoulder width apart.  According to CrossFit, you can typically lift 30% more weight with the push press than with the shoulder press and 30% more with the push jerk than with the push press.",

There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back.

It's an easier exercise to perform than the traditional back squat for newbies and a good choice for long-legged folk.  Whilst good for beginners the goblet squat is still a great exercise in its own right and worth integrating into your routine. It's a simple and safe squatting movement, challenges a load of muscle in one movement and really gets the heart pumping.  You can perform the goblet squat with dumbbells, sandbags, medicine balls and most other weighted objects too, but the kettlebell is perfectly moulded for the goblet squat because you can hold it around the side handles and keep it nice and contained against the chest.",

Keep your head looking slightly upwards. Now bend your knees and push back your hips. Keep your back straight as your lower your body. Continue until your quads are parallel with the ground.

      "tips": "Technique is very important in this lift. The tendency is to arch the low back during the upward phase, increasing the loading upon your spine. Use a mirror for feedback, press overhead and not behind your head, and squeeze your abdominal muscles and glutes to help prevent excessive arching. - See more at: http://www.acefitness.org/acefit/fitness_programs_exercise_library_details.aspx?exerciseid=71#sthash.JhSAtYcf.dpuf To get the bar into position, you can either explosively heave it up off the floor and up to your shoulders, or set the bar at shoulder level on the supports of a power rack. If the bar is on the rack, nudge it off and let it rest against the front of your shoulders. Never allow the bar to touch your upper chest when you lower it. If you find that it does, raise your elbows up slightly. This will prevent your delts from stretching too much. Pressing heavy loads requires significant recovery time, so limit the exercise to one workout per week. The first rep is the hardest because the lift starts with no eccentric [lowering] phase and no stretch reflex. After the first rep, the reflex will kick in to help you.",
